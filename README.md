Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how I'll approach the development:

State Management: Using BLoC/Cubit for managing app state efficiently.

Local Database: I'll use either Hive (lightweight, fast) or Drift (for SQL-like queries) for data persistence.

CRUD Operations: Implement add, edit, and delete functionality for employee records.

Date Picker: Ensure the UI and functionality match the design exactly.

Responsive UI: Make sure the app scales properly on different screen sizes.
